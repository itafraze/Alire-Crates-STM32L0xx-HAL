This repository provides the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_%28software%29[HAL] library for the
STMicroelectronics
link:https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32l0-series.html[STM32L0]
MCU series and is intended to be distributed via the
link:https://alire.ada.dev/[Alire] package manager. This library, ported from
C to Ada, is based on the following projects:

== Development

Requests and reporting::
Please report bugs or feature requests to the project maintainers, preferably
using the
link:https://gitlab.com/ezetec-alire-crates/stm32l0xx-hal/-/issues[issues
tracker].

Workflow::
The project development workflow is inspired by the
link:https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[GitFlow]
branching model. Although strict naming conventions are not enforced,
`feature` branches should branch from `develop` and `fix` branches from `main`
or latest `release`.

Alire aliases::
Alire aliases can be configured to simplify frequent toolchain operations,
especially if involving the `.gpr` project file or environment variables
provided by Alire. Script file link:make-aliases.sh[make-aliases.sh] is
provided to configure the following aliases:
+
* `alr emu`: (tests subproject) Execute tests in emulated environment;
* `alr emugdb`: (tests subproject) Execute tests in emulated environment with
GDB server enabled;
* `alr gdbemu`: (tests subproject) Launch GDB and connect to emulated
tests instance.
+
These aliases use GNATemu and GDB, hence they require `arm-eabi-gnatemu` and
`arm-eabi-gdb` to be available in `$PATH`. At the time of writing, the former
is not available through Alire. However non-GNATPro users may still find
available ARM ELF GNAT Community Edition, which ships also the
`arm-eabi-gnatemu` binary, at AdaCore's
link:https://www.adacore.com/download[Download page].

Tests and debug on emulated target::
The target platform can be emulated using GNATemu. Sub-crate project
link:./tests/tests.gpr[`tests/tests.gpr`] supplies the `Emulator` package with
minimal working configuration. To run `tests` in the emulated environment,
execute from within the sub-project folder the following command.
+
.Start tests in emulation environment
[source,console]
----
$ alr emu
----
+
To debug `tests`, within its folder run the following commands, in two
separated terminals, to start GNATemu followed by GDB.
+
.Start GNATemu
[source,console]
----
$ alr emugdb
----
+
.Start GDB
[source,console]
----
$ alr gdbemu
----
